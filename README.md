# IT414_Unit_2_Assignment_Jonathan
Reflection

I was in a prior software programming class where I used Visual Studio and C# to make coding projects. I could have used that infrastructure that was already built in, but I decided to challenge myself by using a new GUI and programming language. I was always interested in Python and I took the opportunity to use it. I first tried to use Visual Studio to run Python but there was a lack of infrastructure around it like no build deployment or CLI supporting Python. I also tried using the text editor IDE but there were many problems with complaining about that. So, I eventually stumbled upon Sublime Text. It had the most effective ease of use but there was still a lot of infrastructure needed to be built to start developing. I noticed that ease-of-use is a big thing for developers from this experience as that was nearly the entire battle with this assignment. However, once my developer environment was set up with all the tools I needed, I created my code and my unit tests, and they ran as intended.
